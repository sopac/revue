# Revue Tool
### Field Data Validation

Under the Capacity Building on the Hazard and Exposure Database for the PCRAFI Project, the assets and utilities data-sets are collected and refreshed using location-centric data collection work-flows on hand-held positioning devices such as GPS devices, mobile phones, tablets etc. As the data collection activities are undertaken by multiple teams across multiple locations/countries, a monitoring and validation mechanism is needed to ensure the quality control and quality assurance of the collected data-sets before they are exposed in the public domain on the Pacific Risk Information System. The data collected by forms within hand-held devices adhere to the PCRAFI 2 Assets Data Collection Template and Attributes agreed upon by national and technical stakeholders in a regional meeting in 2020. The Revue tool, in essence, enforces adherence to the PCRAFI 2 template, so that all data loaded onto Pacific Risk Information System is uniform across countries and thematic sectors.


The Revue tool also allows data owners and stakeholders to manage additional information collected or generated during the field survey process; including photographs of buildings and other utility assets, user information, data quality statements etc, and edit them before being finalised for upload and exposure within PacRIS.
